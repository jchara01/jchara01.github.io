        My name is Judy Charamand. I am from Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, a small country in the Middle East. I spent the majority
        of my life in my home country, and was educated in French at an International school. I later came to the United States, Boston 
        specifically, to pursue my undergraduate education at Tufts University. I am currently studying Human Factors Engineering which 
        has been an enlightening journey so far. My goal and dream since I was 15 years old is to become successful, not in terms of money, 
        but in terms of bettering the human quality of life and making a noticeable change for all.
