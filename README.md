This Lab consists of creating my first very own website, representing a personal portfolio, using HTML5 and CSS. There are three web pages: index.html, resume.html and bio.html. The way I approached this lab is by coding every web page on its own before linking them all together through hyperlinks.
It seems the majority of the work has been implemented correctly since i had the files validated using the official HTML5 specifications and the official CSS validation. However, it is always possible that i have missed something that i did not implement perfectly.
In order to complete the lab I had access to the Comp 20 piazza page, where I posted whatever inquiries I had. I also used google and resources provided by the professor on the Comp 20 page quite offen to figure out the basic html and css syntax.
The lab took me about 6 hours to complete.
